        <h2>Spiderman Catches Notorious Criminal Hevy</h2>

          Hevy the big bad guy who lives in the dump and is known for his
          criminal activities has been captured by Spiderman. He was caught in
          the act of stealing a truck full of valuable items from a local
          business. Spiderman, who was on patrol in the area, spotted Hevy and
          then he webbed him up before he could escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          The police were called to the scene, and Hevy was taken into custody
          without incident. This marks a significant victory for Spiderman and
          the local community, who have been dealing with Hevy's criminal
          activities for some time now. The stolen items were recovered and
          returned to their rightful owners.
