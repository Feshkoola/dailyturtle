          The hideout of the legendary Big Turtle has been discovered in a
          remote area of the forest. This hideout, known for its secretive and
          elusive nature, has been the subject of many rumors and legends among
          many the locals

          The turtle who has in the past know to have partnered with Hevy, the
          notorious criminal, has robbed countless banks and stores, leaving
          behind a trail of confusion and mystery. the discovery of the hideout
          has brought about a lot of excitement and curiosity among the
          community, as the Big Turtle has never been caught or seen in person.
          The only evidence of his existence is the CCTV footage from the banks
          and stores he has robbed, which shows a large turtle-like figure
          moving swiftly and stealthily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Big Turtle is know for his unusual obsession with shiny objects, and
          his hideout is rumored to be filled with stolen treasures and
          artifacts. The authorities are now investigating the hideout, hoping
          to find clues that could lead them to the Big Turtle and put an end to
          his criminal activities.

          He is also well know for his use of firearms, which he uses to
          intimidate and threaten his victims. The police are taking this matter
          very seriously and have urged the public to stay away from the hideout
          until they can ensure it is safe. In the past he as been known to use
          his firearms to shoot at anyone who gets too close to his hideout, so
          it is important for everyone to exercise caution and stay away from
          the area. One one particular ocassion, when robbing the White House,
          he shot all 60 security guards using only 6 bullets, which is a
          testament to his skill and precision with firearms. The President
          himself had been shot in the leg, but fortunately he survived the
          attack. Beware!
