        <h2>Lizard Captured by SWAT Team</h2>
        <p>

          After a long and intense manhunt, the notorious criminal known as the
          Lizard has been captured by a SWAT team. The Lizard, who has been on
          the run for muliple months, was finally located in a remote area of
          the city. The SWAT team, equipped with AK-47s and other heavy
          weaponry, surrounded the area and apprehended the Lizard with
          difficulty. He was found in a bank vault, where he had been hiding out
          and reading the news.

          The Lizard was actually watchin the live footage of the SWAT team
          surrounding the area, and he was caught off guard when they stormed
          in. The SWAT team fired several warning shots to intimidate the
          Lizard, who was known for his violent tendencies and use of firearms.
          The team attempted to subdue him but he pulled out a gun and
          threatened to shoot anyone who came near. In total he killed 3
          officers and injured about 70 others, downed 6 F-22 fighter jets and
          destroyed 3 tanks before he was finally subdued by the SWAT team.

          In total, the whole gunfight lasted for about 3 hours, with the Lizard
          firing at the SWAT team and the team returning fire. Millions of
          people watched the live footage of the incident, which was broadcasted
          on national television. The Lizard was finally subdued when the SWAT
          decided to explode the largest conventional bomb in the world, which
          was dropped from a helicopter. The explosion was so powerful that it
          cracked his shell, but he still persisted, blinded by the smoke and
          debris. The SWAT team used Infrared cameras to locate him and finally
          subdued him with a taser using 2000 Voltage, which was enough to knock
          him out cold.
